# Terry Johnson | Computer Science ePortfolio
## Full-Stack & DevOps Professional

Welcome to my professional ePortfolio. I have been in the SNHU Computer Science program since August 2022. This site serves as a showcase for my technical growth, bridging my 3 years of experience in IT/Networking with advanced software engineering practices.

### Current Project: Guardian Path

* **Software Engineering (Enhancement One):** [Read Narrative](./artifacts/software-engineering/narrative.md) | [View Source Code](https://github.com/Terryj1215/Guardian_Path_Application)
    * Successfully transitioned from a paper prototype to a modular C++ architecture using Visual Studio and the Qt Framework.
    * Implemented a centralized safety hub featuring real-time location tracking and appliance monitoring.
    * Utilized Qt’s Signal-Slot mechanism for event-driven navigation and managed memory via Qt Object Trees to prevent leaks.

* **Algorithms and Data Structure (Enhancement Two):** [Read Narrative](./artifacts/algorithms/narrative.md) | [View Source Code](https://github.com/Terryj1215/Guardian_Path_Application/tree/main/src)
    * Developed a dynamic geospatial engine by implementing the **Haversine Formula** to calculate great-circle distances for real-time geofence validation.
    * Integrated an **Asynchronous Geocoding Search Algorithm** to transform string-based user input into precise geographic coordinates ($Latitude, Longitude$).
    * Engineered a **Cross-Platform Data Bridge** between C++ backend logic and a QML frontend to maintain state-persistence across the mapping layer.
    * Optimized spatial data structures to support user-defined safety parameters, allowing for dynamic real-time updates to the geofence boundary.
