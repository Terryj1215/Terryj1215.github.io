Professional Self-Assessment
🚀 Introduction & Professional Journey
My journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been a bridge between my established career in IT/Networking and my growth as a Software Engineer. Since 2022, 
I have transitioned from managing physical and virtual infrastructure to architecting complex software solutions. My experience as an IT Network Lead Specialist provided me with a "systems-thinking" 
perspective that I now apply to full-stack development. This portfolio showcases my ability to integrate high-level software design, advanced algorithmic logic, and secure database management into cohesive, 
industry-standard applications.

🤝 Collaboration & Stakeholder Communication
In my professional role at Computer Backup, I serve as the primary point of contact for diverse clients, including city governments and school systems.
Stakeholder Engagement: I have developed the ability to translate complex technical issues into actionable insights for non-technical audiences, a skill vital for any software engineering team.
Problem Solving: Whether I am troubleshooting network connectivity or presenting a software prototype, I focus on clear, professional communication regarding technical trade-offs and project goals.

💻 Software Engineering and Design
My growth in software engineering is best exemplified by the Guardian Path project.
Architectural Shift: I transitioned this project from a conceptual paper prototype to a modular, event-driven C++ architecture.
Framework Mastery: By utilizing the Qt Framework and its Signal-Slot mechanism, I implemented a centralized safety hub featuring real-time monitoring and a responsive UI/UX.
Memory Management: This project pushed me to manage complex object lifecycles using Qt Object Trees to prevent memory leaks, ensuring the application remains performant and stable.

🔢 Algorithms and Data Structures
To solve real-world geospatial problems, I engineered a dynamic geofencing engine for Guardian Path.
Haversine Formula: I implemented the Haversine Formula to calculate great-circle distances, allowing for real-time geofence validation.
Geocoding: I integrated an Asynchronous Geocoding Search Algorithm to transform string-based user input into precise geographic coordinates.
Optimization: These enhancements demonstrate my ability to use spatial data structures to support dynamic, real-time updates.

🗄️ Databases and Data Management
Moving beyond volatile local memory, I integrated a MongoDB NoSQL backend to provide persistent, cloud-based storage.
CRUD Functionality: I implemented full CRUD capabilities using the MongoDB C++ driver for the "Care Ring" feature.
Data Integrity: By refactoring data models to use QString identifiers mapped to MongoDB ObjectIDs, I ensured state-persistence across the dashboard.

🛡️ Security Mindset
Security is the common thread between my networking background and my software development practices.
Infrastructure Security: In my professional work, I configure firewalls, VPNs, and secure port forwarding to protect client data.
Software Security: I carried this mindset into my capstone by focusing on data privacy, ensuring that sensitive location and contact data are managed through secure database connections and robust architecture.

🎯 Conclusion
The artifacts presented in this ePortfolio represent the culmination of my academic and professional efforts. They demonstrate that I am capable of writing clean, efficient code while managing the 
infrastructure and data layers that modern applications require. I am prepared to leverage this unique blend of DevOps, Networking, and Software Engineering to contribute to innovative technical teams.
